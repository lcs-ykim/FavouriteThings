Troye Sivan portrays a wide sectrum of emotions through his music. His melody is sad but bright, and his words are helpless but empowering.
"""), Segment(image: "Bloom",
              text: """
Troye's second studio album 'Bloom' best expresses his identity as a musician and a person. I personally like the visuals in the music video of the title track 'Bloom' because they embody Troye's sexuality and suggest how a person cannot be defined by one's gender.
"""), Segment(image: "BlueNeighbourhood",
              text: """
'Blue Neighbourhood' is my favourite album of Troye Sivan. Every track in this album is Troye narrating his young, unrefined love. Listening to this somewhat relatable story through the one-of-a-kind singer's voice is a catharsis for me. I especially like the tracks 'FOOLS', 'TALK ME DOWN', 'HEAVEN', 'YOUTH', and 'for him.'

              text: """
Out of his latest releases, I like 'Easy', 'Rager teenager', and 'IN A DREAM'. I hope more people find out about this man because he is not only talented but ADORABLE!

        I started playing hockey last year and I knew that this is the exact type of leisure I was looking for my entire life. Although I am a mediocre player, I enjoy every nanosecond on ice. This year, I will focus on improving key skills like puck handling and skating. Also, I can't wait for Friday Night Lights!
